## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Local web server (optional but recommended)
- Google account (for admin authentication)

### Installation (Development)
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure keys
3. Run with Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

### Installation (Production)
The project includes a production-ready container setup supporting **Docker** and **Podman**.

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```
This script automates:
- Multi-stage build (Rust -> Debian Slim)
- Database persistence setup
- Caddy reverse proxy (auto-HTTPS) configuration

### Usage
1. **Create a Session**: Use the poll creation wizard to set up your campaign
2. **Invite Players**: Add participant email addresses
3. **Mark Availability**: Players use the interactive grid to indicate their availability
4. **Analyze Overlap**: View heat maps and recommendations for optimal times
5. **Finalize Session**: Select the best time and notify all participants

### Admin Setup (Optional)

For production deployment with Google OAuth:

1. **Set up Google OAuth** (see [GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md](./GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md))
   - Create Google Cloud project
   - Configure OAuth credentials
   - Add authorized redirect URIs
   - Update Client ID in admin-manager.js

2. **Configure Admin Access**
   - Add admin email addresses to whitelist
   - Set up proper domain and HTTPS
   - Test authentication flow

**For immediate testing**: The admin panel includes a demo authentication system that works without Google OAuth setup. Use the "Sign in with Google (Demo)" button for admin access.
