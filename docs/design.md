# D&D Session Scheduler - Design Style Guide

## Design Philosophy

### Core Aesthetic: Mystical Modernism
The design merges the mystical, adventurous spirit of Dungeons & Dragons with contemporary web design principles. We're creating an interface that feels both magical and professional, evoking the atmosphere of a wizard's study or ancient library while maintaining the clarity and usability expected from modern scheduling tools.

### Color Palette: Arcane Shadows

- **Accent**: Mystic Purple (#6b5b95) - suggesting magical elements and mystery
- **Background**: Soft Cream (#faf8f5) - like aged paper or parchment

- **Success**: Emerald (#4a7c59) - for available times and positive actions
